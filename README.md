# Crashtest

This APP is my crash test. I work on it to learn flutter and get used of it.
For now what I've worked on:
<ul>
  <li>Layouts</li>
  <li>API Calls with FutureBuilder</li>
  <li>Navigator<li>
</ul>

I didn't dive into it deeply yet, but I will as soon as I get comfortable using Widgets in their base functions.
